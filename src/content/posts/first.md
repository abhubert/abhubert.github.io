# First Post

Welcome to the new and improved homepage for me, Aleksander. I previously had written my website using Jekyll but a laptop move and the brittleness of ruby made be decide for a redesign. I went with Astro since I have heard good things and already have familiarity with JS. The goal of the site has ranged from showcasing my ability to design fun complicate static sides but I decided to go simpler after a couple weeks of designing something very unique but hard to maintain. With this much simpler site I hope to keep it more up to date and share my thoughts from my previous experiences and current interests.
